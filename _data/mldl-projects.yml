  description: This project trains a series of next-token language models, starting from a linear predictor through multilayer perceptrons, self-attention, and small transformers. Character-level experiments use Tiny Shakespeare, while word-level experiments adapt the same transformer backbone to WikiText-2 and Penn Treebank (PTB). Hyperparameter sweeps compare context length, embedding size, depth/width, attention heads, optimizers, schedulers, and batch sizes, with results logged to report_src/ alongside plots and generated text samples.
